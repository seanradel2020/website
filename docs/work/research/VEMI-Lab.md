# VEMI Lab

### About 
The VEMI Lab specializes in Human-Computer Interaction and Inclusive Technology that harnesses multisensory information based on the integration of a combination of sensory cues (including visual, auditory, touch and haptics, and natural language) to mirror how the brain works. As an undergraduate developer at VEMI, I mainly managed our server infrastructure and physical computers, but I also co-wrote one paper which did not get published.


**Server and IT Development**
I was responsible for maintaining our TrueNAS server which hosted the following services in FreeBSD Jails: GrayLog, PostgreSQL, Gitea, OpenVPN, VEMI Wiki, and other VEMI specific services. I also managed our Cisco router and organizing any IT related equipment. 


**Talk to the Hand: Human Interpretation of Common Gestures** 
This paper was written in January, 2023 during a VEMI Lab rapid research week where student groups have one week to plan and conduct, and write a research paper. Our research question was: Is there a commonly understood gesture that signals a universal command? Our background was that gestures serve as an important tool for communication and have the potential to be used in various technologies for human-computer interaction (HCI). Our purpose was to achieve a greater understanding of universally understood gestures to better program gesture recognition software. Only one gesture was universally understoon, and all other gestures had mixed interpretations.
