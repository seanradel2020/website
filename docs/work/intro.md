### More

**CyberArk**  
During my internship at CyberArk, I gained hands-on experience as a cloud security engineer intern. I am one of
two security champions on a DevOps team and have developed internal tools for scanning AWS resources
for compliance. I utilize Jenkins and Pulumi to build and provision resources. For the remaining
three months of my internship, I will focus on managing our Jenkins platform, implementing security
scanners into our pipeline, and developing our CI/CD pipeline for our FedRamp environments.

**University of Maine** 
While at the University of Maine, I worked at the VEMI Lab and the Scalable & Portable Infrastructure
for Cybersecurity Education (SPICE) lab. I am also a research assistant with the Privacy Engineering
Regulatory Compliance Lab (PERC_Lab). 

I am a teaching assistant for UMaine’s Introduction to Cybersecurity, which covers the nature of network and computer attacks, system vulnerabilities and
defense; and implementation issues in Unix/Linux. I help students understand OWASP's top 10, MITRE’s
CVEs and CWEs, and CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.

**SPICE Lab** 
At the SPICE lab, I had the opportunity to lead our research team in the development of cloud and
physical server infrastructure. As the team moderator, I led our planning meetings and helped delegate
short-term tasks. I developed our logging solution using Wazuh and the Elastic Stack technologies and
automated patching and maintenance with Ansible.

To assist with our goals, I used Terraform and Docker-Compose to automate Amazon Web Services provisioning and deployment of services within
containers. We utilized Docker containers to create scalable cybersecurity labs hosted for University of
Maine Cybersecurity Team members.

**UMCST** 
As president of the University of Maine Cybersecurity Team, I led recruits through an ethical hacking lab
and co-led Linux security, basic networking, and networking enumeration labs. I briefed members on
cybersecurity current events and technologies each week and led work sessions to prepare for
competitions. Notably, I captained our third-place winning team at the Northeast Collegiate Cyber
Defense competition.
