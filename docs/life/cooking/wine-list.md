|-----------|---------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Zulai, Areni  | 2019    | 4.1    | Vayots Dzor, Armenia   | May, 2023 | It reminded me of a Pinot Noir, but kind of spicy - notes of cherry, blackberry, and pepper. A little earthy as well. This was a dark red, ruby wine. |
| Clay Shannon, Cabernet Sauvignon  | 2020    | 4.1    |  California - North Coast  | June, 2023 | Oak, tobacco, dark fruit notes, sort of dry medium acidity, not really smooth or tannic. Very very good wine, I was happy with this bottle. |
| Shaya, Blanco   | 2020    | 4.0    | Ruedo, Spain    | June, 2023 | Very good Spanish white wine. Fruit forward with an alcoholic taste. |
| Hunky Dory, Sauvignon Blanc   | 2021    | 4.3    | Marlborough, New Zealand | June, 2023 | Crisp, dry white wine. Very acidic, with a tropical fruity flavor. |
| Domino de Punctum, Lobetia Tempranillo  | 2018    | 3.9    | La Mancha, Spain | June, 2023 | Solid wine, organic, cheap ($10.99) and had a pretty label. |
| Domaine Lafage, Cote Est Blanc  | 2020    | 3.8    | Cotes Catalanes, France| June, 2023 | Crisp, green apple, and light. Dry wine, with a lemon color. |
| Maugle Sierra, St. Croix  | Unknown    | 3.3    | Ledyard, Connecticut| June, 2023 | I tried this wine at the winery in Ledyard CT. It was very spicey, with notes of blackberry and pepper. I was the only one of the group that liked this particular bottle.|
| Maugle Sierra, Rendezvous  | 2019    | 4.7    | Ledyard, Connecticut| June, 2023 | I tried this wine at the winery in Ledyard CT. This was a great white wine with notes of peach and apricot. This wine was a mix of Chardonnay and Riesling grapes. This bottle was the favorite among the group. |
| Maugle Sierra, 1740 Ledyard House Rosé  | 2019    | 3.0    | Ledyard, Connecticut| June, 2023 | I should have rated this wine lower. I found it boozy and had odd flavors.  |
| Santa Maria La Palma, Aragosta Rosé | Unknown | 4.1    | Alghero, Italy| August, 2023 | I paired this wine with homemade pasta and shrimp scampi. It was a really good bottle to add to the night. Semi-dry, and smooth.  |
| Domaine Lafage, Novellum Chardonnay | 2021 | 4.2 | Languedoc-Roussillon, France | August, 2023 | This bottle was amazing. I had this while I was making a pasta dough. Dry, yellowish hue, refreshing wine. | 
| Sea Sun, Pinot Noir | 2021 | 4.5 | Fairfield, California | August, 2023 | I tried this wine at a good friend's wedding. It was a great wine for the occasion. The wine had fruity aromas with plum, cherry, and strawberry notes. | 
| Wycliff, Brut | Unknown | 4.2 | California | August, 2023 | Another wine from the wedding. This one was good, notably fruity, Great for an $8 bottle of wine. | 
| Ferrari Carano, Tré Terre Chardonnay | 2018 | 4.3 | Sonoma County, California | August, 2023 | Another wine from the wedding. This was the best white wine of the bunch. Apple and pear aromas, full bodied, long finish.| 
| La Marca, Prosecco | Unknown | 3.7 | Italy | August, 2023 | Final wine from the wedding. This was an okay wine, there wasn't anything notable about it. Fizzy, citrus| 
| High Table, Cabernet Sauvignon | 2021 | 3.5 | France | September, 2023 | This was a good wine for the price ($7.99). Oaky, blackberry, and cherry notes. Classic table wine. | 
| Masi, Campofiorin | 2019 | 3.9 | Rosso Veronese, Italy | October, 2023 | I had this wine in the North End of Boston. It was a good wine - deep ruby, tobacco and cherry. | 
| Isaac Fernandez, Biutiful Cava Brut Rosé | Unknown | 3.9 | Cava, Spain | November, 2023 | I had this Rosé with red wine infused turkey and champagne mashed potatoes. It was a very nice pairing. Slightly fizzy, and slightly acidic. Flavors of cherry, strawberry, and raspberry. |
