# Wine List 

**Below you will find my list of wine ratings and reviews. I am a novice wine taster and I rate these wines very liberally, so please, take them with a grain of salt. All ratings are out of 5.**

| Wine Name | Vintage | Rating | Location | Review Date | Review |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Zulai, Areni  | 2019    | 4.1    | Vayots Dzor, Armenia   | May, 2023 | It reminded me of a Pinot Noir, but kind of spicy - notes of cherry, blackberry, and pepper. A little earthy as well. This was a dark red, ruby wine. |
| Clay Shannon, Cabernet Sauvignon  | 2020    | 4.1    |  California - North Coast  | June, 2023 | Oak, tobacco, dark fruit notes, sort of dry medium acidity, not really smooth or tannic. Very very good wine, I was happy with this bottle. |
| Shaya, Blanco   | 2020    | 4.0    | Ruedo, Spain    | June 2023 | Very good Spanish white wine. Fruit forward with an alcoholic taste. |
| Hunky Dory, Sauvignon Blanc   | 2021    | 4.3    | Marlborough, New Zealand | June 2023 | Crisp, dry white wine. Very acidic, with a tropical fruity flavor. |
