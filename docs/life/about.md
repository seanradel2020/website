# About Me

**As much as I love my work on computers, I love to get off of them sometimes. I'm an avid chef, I love wine tasting as well as craft beer. I like to hike, fish, surf, and in 2023 I learned how to sail. I've been learning to golf, but I've played soccer and wrestled my entire life. Currently, I play intramural soccer at UMaine, and will look to play in adult leagues after graduating. I stay active in the wrestling community by volunteer coaching at Kennebunk High School, and pracaticing with the UMaine Wrestling Team. I started gardening in 2022, and have enjoyed fresh strawberries, carrots, tomatoes, and flowers.**

### Leadership

I strive to be a leader in all aspects of life. Leadership is something that is very important to me, and my drive to be a leader as pushed me to reach a lot of my goals. Whether it be in sports, research, work, or student organizations, I am proud of the leadership opportunities I have taken. My motto as a leader is: **Give credit, take blame**. What this means to me is to always recognize your peers and your followers for their effort and contribution, and to never hide from your failures or shortcomings. I think it is important as a leader to take ownership of your mistakes, and work through them to find a solution. This is something I practice in my own life to help me better myself. I strive to be an empathetic leader who uses strong reasoning and analytical thinking, as well as emotional understanding.  

### Wine, Cooking, Beer
**Wine -** I enjoy trying new wines and wine pairings. I owe many thanks to Betsy Ross at [Wine House On Maine](https://www.winehousemaine.com/) for introducing me to so many great wines. When I started my wine journey, I only liked fruity whites and ros√©s, but I've really grown to appreciate red wine. My favorite in particular is Cabernet Sauvignon.  

**Cooking -** I make a mean pizza, I've recently been learning how to make bread from scratch, and I also make pasta from scratch. I regularly cook a range of recipes but I love italian food. My favorite dish to make is shrimp scampi with homemade pasta. 

**Beer -** Beer is a very popular subject in college. I was lucky enough to take a course on it - Brewing with Food Science. The course focused on the process of beer making as well as the ingredients that go into beer and their functions. I love going to breweries with my friends, my favorite one in particualr is [Marsh Island Brewing](https://www.marshislandbrewing.com/), they make a killer stout.

**Wrestling -** Growing up, wrestling was a big part of my life. Through wrestling I learned how to overcome physical and mental challenges, and push myself further than I thought I could ever go.

I was the captain of the Kennebunk High School wrestling team, and the President of the University of Maine Wrestling team.
