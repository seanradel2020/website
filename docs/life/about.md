# About Me

**As much as I love my work on computers, I love to get off of them sometimes. I'm an avid chef, I love wine tasting as well as craft beer. I like to hike, fish, surf, and in 2023 I learned how to sail. I've been learning to golf, but I've played soccer and wrestled my entire life. I currently play intramural soccer at UMaine, and will look to play in adult leagues after graduating. I stay active in the wrestling community by volunteer coaching at Kennebunk High School, and pracaticing with the UMaine Wrestling Team. I started gardening in 2022, and have enjoyed fresh strawberries, carrots, tomatoes, and flowers.**

### Wine, Cooking, Beer
**Wine -** I enjoy trying new wines and wine pairings. I owe many thanks to Betsy Ross at [Wine House On Maine](https://www.winehousemaine.com/) for introducing me to so many great wines. When I started my wine journey, I only liked fruity whites and ros√©s, but I've really grown to appreciate red wine. My favorite in particular is Cabernet Sauvignon.  

**Cooking -** I make a mean pizza, I've recently been learning how to make bread from scratch, and I also make pasta from scratch. My meals are usually heavy in meat, beans, and vegetables, but I also love italian food. My favorite dish to make is shrimp scampi with homemade pasta. 

**Beer -** Beer is a very popular subject in college. I was lucky enough to take a course on it - Brewing with Food Science. The course focused on the process of beer making as well as the ingredients that go into beer and their functions. I love going to breweries with my friends, my favorite one in particualr is [Marsh Island Brewing](https://www.marshislandbrewing.com/), they make a killer stout.
