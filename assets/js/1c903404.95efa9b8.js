In this paper, we aim to understand developers' privacy challenges by evaluating the types of privacy-related questions asked on Stack Overflow. We then conduct a comparative analysis between the accepted responses given by Stack Overflow users and the responses produced by ChatGPT for those extracted questions to identify if ChatGPT could serve as a viable alternative. Our results show that most privacy-related questions are related to choice/consent, aggregation, and identification.

Next, we developed an annotation strategy to classify the types of QAs based on two well-known privacy taxonomies.
