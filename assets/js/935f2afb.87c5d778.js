I enjoy cooking and take pleasure in wine tasting and exploring craft beers. Hiking, fishing, surfing, and sailing, a skill I picked up in 2023, are among my favorite outdoor activivies. I\'ve recently taken up golf, but my lifelong sports have been soccer and wrestling. I currently participate in intramural soccer at UMaine and plan to join adult leagues post-graduation. My connection to wrestling remains strong through my volunteer coaching at Kennebunk High School and practicing with the UMaine Wrestling Team. In 2022, I discovered a love for gardening, enjoying the fruits of my labor with fresh strawberries, carrots, tomatoes, and beautiful flowers.","sidebar":"lifeSidebar"},"life/cooking/wine-list":{"id":"life/cooking/wine-list","title":"Wine List","description":"Below you will find my list of wine ratings and reviews.
