The goal of this project is to build a solution for managing and tracking sports equipment and apparel. The key stakeholders for our project are Jude Killy, Nick Fox, and Kevin Ritz. Jude Killy submitted the project on behalf of the athletic department to combat the issue of an inefficient inventory management process. Currently, Nick Fox and Kevin Ritz are tasked with managing inventory orders and distribution of items to players and teams. The inventory is currently only documented on a spreadsheet.

The user will be immediately prompted to log in on arrival to the website. The system will leverage federated identity provider integration to allow the user to utilize their University of Maine login credentials to access the system like they would with any other University of Maine service. After the authentication and authorization process, the user attains access to the rest of the user interface system. From the main UI, the user will be able to perform actions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting items from the database. The final interface is shown when the user logs out or reaches an error.  The back-end subsystem will process user requests on the web page and handle API calls to the database. The database will be a cloud-hosted solution and will securely store all of our system data as well as manage our user authentication.
