I\'m an avid chef, I love wine tasting as well as craft beer. I like to hike, fish, surf, and in 2023 I learned how to sail. I\'ve been learning to golf, but I\'ve played soccer and wrestled my entire life. Currently, I play intramural soccer at UMaine, and will look to play in adult leagues after graduating. I stay active in the wrestling community by volunteer coaching at Kennebunk High School, and pracaticing with the UMaine Wrestling Team. I started gardening in 2022, and have enjoyed fresh strawberries, carrots, tomatoes, and flowers.","sidebar":"lifeSidebar"},"life/cooking/wine-list":{"id":"life/cooking/wine-list","title":"Wine List","description":"Below you will find my list of wine ratings and reviews.
